INTRO
_____

We begin by learning the server CRUD API (create, read, update & delete).

Then we'll start building our client side with HTML5, JQuery mobile and bootstrap

Finally we connect the app with the api, test and deploy.

Good luck!

Lesson 1
_________
1: Go to your account on github and create the repo you want to use. Maybe add a md file.

2: Then in Aptana, File - Import - Git - Git Repository as New Project, follow directions on screen for github username & password and the url for the repo (you can go to your github account and copy the url ('https://github.com/userName/repoName.git')

3: Do some work in Aptana, add files, folder, etc. then in Aptana's project browser right click on the project name, team - stage, commit, push (in that order)
